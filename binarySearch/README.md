# Welcome to Week 4 of JSP!

It is Binary Search week for toy problems. These easy and medium level prompts will reinforce your knowledge of binary data structures (binary trees, binary search trees, heaps) and algorithms (binary searches, heapsort). For days 1-4, you will work solo, and then on day 5 you will pair to continue your work on the day 4 prompt.
