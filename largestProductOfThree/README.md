# Welcome to the first pair toy problems of JSP!

This week, we’re solving some old familiar toy problems from HR, specially selected for their frequent use in job interviews.

We're using __VCS LiveShare__ today, along with a test run of a new pairing script that will randomly select a driver and a navigator for each module. At the start of the pair module, you and your partner will receive a Slack with each other’s names and driver/navigator assignment for the toy problem.

At the end of the module, we’ll send you two links to complete before moving on to the next event on the JSP calendar:

1. Toy Problem Survey (30 seconds)
2. Pair Feedback form (5 minutes)

We’re giving you 45 minutes (a bit of extra time) for this pair session.

### Have extra time after solving?

1. Switch driver/navigator roles and approach the problem differently.
2. Work together to improve time or space complexity.
3. New navigator picks another toy problem from the HR archives (like nthFibonacci) to work through
4. Get to know each other!
