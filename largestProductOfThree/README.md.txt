Welcome to the first pair toy problem of JSP!

This week, we’re solving some old familiar toy problems from HR, specially selected for their frequent use in job interviews.

Since Zoom has a limit of breakout rooms available for a meeting, we are testing out a new pairing script that will randomly select a driver and a navigator for each module, this time using VCS LiveShare. At the start of the pair module, you and your partner will receive a Slack with each other’s names and driver/navigator assignment for the toy problem.

At the end of the module, we’ll send you two links to complete before moving on to the next event on the JSP calendar:

1) Toy Problem Survey (30 seconds)
2) Pair Feedback form (5 minutes)

We’re giving you 40 minutes (a bit of extra time) for this pair module.

Have extra time after solving? Switch driver/navigator roles and work with one of these ideas:

1) Switch driver/navigator roles and approach the problem differently.
2) New navigator picks another toy problem from the HR archives to work through (like nthFibonacci)
3) Get to know each other!
