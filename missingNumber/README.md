# Welcome to Week 2 of JSP!

It is Apple week in toy problems. These easy and medium level prompts are commonly seen in SE interviews at Apple (which means that many smaller companies use these as interview prompts, too). As always, these mock interview prompts are an opportunity to focus on building out the logic of each solution, even if you have not memorized algorithms or syntax. Use your personal coding formula from W1.

All of this week's prompts are available on Leetcode. Whether you solve in your own IDE or on Leetcode, you can view walkthrough in the Solution tab for the problem in Leetcode. Link is provided in .js file for each prompt.

At the start of the pair module, you and your partner will receive a Slack with each other’s names and interviewer/job seeker assignment for the toy problem. Please review [Pair Coding Roles](https://github.com/hackreactor/hrjsp1-toy-problems/blob/master/PAIRING_ROLES.md)  for clarity on the roles.

At the end of the module, we’ll send you two links to complete before moving on to the next event on the JSP calendar:

1. Toy Problem Survey (30 seconds)
2. Pair Feedback form (5 minutes)
