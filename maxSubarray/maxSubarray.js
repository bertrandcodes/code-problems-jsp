/* 53. Maximum Subarray
Solve in IDE or on Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.



Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
