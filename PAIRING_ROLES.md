# Pair Coding Roles

For most pair toy problems, you and your pair partner will be each assigned a role: Interviewer or Job Seeker. In the case of an odd number of participants, three people may be “paired”. In that case, there will be two Interviewers and one Job Seeker.

## Interviewer

The interviewer will:

1. Explain the problem to the job seeker, including expected output. 
2. Answers any clarifying questions the job seeker may have to define the scope of the problem before they begin.
3. Decide and communicate edge cases when asked.
4. If the job seeker gets stuck, ask leading questions or provide suggestions to get them back on track.

Other prompts to consider while interviewing your partner (if they have not proactively addressed these issues):

* Which algorithm and/or data structures did they use?
* Can they improve on time/space complexity?
* If your job seeker is doing well and has created a working solution, add to the scope of the challenge or create unusual edge cases.

## Job Seeker

The job seeker will:

1. Ask the interviewer clarifying questions to help define the scope of the problem.
2. Inquire about edge cases or unusual input.
3. Talk though the logic of your anticipated solution. Pseudocode or comment if you wish.
4. Write code to implement a solution. Remember to communicate as you write.
5. Ask for advice if you get stuck or need clarity.

If you have a lot of time left, pick another problem from your HR toy problem archives or Leetcode and switch roles. (You’ll only need to submit pair/toy problem feedback on your original roles.)
