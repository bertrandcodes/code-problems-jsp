# Pair Coding Roles

Remote interviews for software engineering roles rely heavily on live pair coding challenges. Typically, these take place in an early round. To prepare you for this type of interview, you and your pair partner will be each assigned a role: Interviewer or Job Seeker. In the case of an odd number of participants, three people may be “paired.” In that case, there will be two Interviewers and one Job Seeker.

## Coding Environment

Sometimes, you will be well-prepared by the company and know on which platform the interview takes place, including whether you can use your own IDE with a screen share. Often, however, you will be coding on a platform that the interviewer reveals at the actual time of the pair code, and you have to adjust to the new coding environment while working under pressure. Therefore, the Interviewer will be the partner to choose the pair method and will initiate the session.

## Interviewer

The interviewer will ... 

1. Choose the pairing method and Slack connection information to their partner. You can utilize:
   - Your personal Zoom room with screenshare (Sorry, but we cannot create breakout rooms from the main room with the large number of JSP participants.)
   - Google Meet with screenshare
   - Visual Code Studio with Live Share/Audio ([Get extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack))
   - Any other pair coding method that you can implement and share quickly with your job seeker

2. Once connected, explain the problem to the job seeker, including expected output. 
3. Answer any clarifying questions the job seeker may have to define the scope of the problem before they begin.
4. Decide and communicate edge cases when asked.
5. If the job seeker gets stuck, ask leading questions or provide suggestions to get them back on track.

Other prompts to consider while interviewing your partner (if they have not proactively addressed these issues):

* Which algorithm and/or data structures did they use?
* Can they improve on time/space complexity?
* If your job seeker is doing well and has created a working solution, add to the scope of the challenge or create unusual edge cases.

## Job Seeker

It is VERY important that you not begin coding immediately. Chances are high that you will receive a code challenge during an interview that you have seen before. Remember that the interviewer is not interested in how many toy problems you have memorized, but rather on your ability to ask insightful questions about the problem in front of you; to communicate your logic and thinking; to consider edge cases; to generate clean and readable code.

The job seeker will:

1. Ask the interviewer clarifying questions to help define the scope of the problem.
2. Inquire about edge cases or unusual input.
3. Talk though the logic of your anticipated solution. Pseudocode or comment if you wish.
4. Write code to implement a solution. Remember to communicate as you write.
5. Ask for advice if you get stuck or need clarity.

If you have a lot of time left, pick another problem from your HR toy problem archives or Leetcode and switch roles. (You’ll only need to submit pair/toy problem feedback on your original roles.)
